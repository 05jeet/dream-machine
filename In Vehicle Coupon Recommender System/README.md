A Machine Learning Approach to Classification. Here is an attempt to build a recommender system to identify weather a customer will accept an in-vehicle digital coupon or not.
This data was originally collected by a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. A csv file of the data is present here in the Datasets folder.
Data set source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/in-vehicle+coupon+recommendation#
A code folder is provided here where a Jupyter notebook In-Vehicle Recommender (1).ipynb is uploaded with illustrative snippets and features of the analysis. I would recommend to view the notebook as it explains the code and analysis better.
Full code can be checked from the invehicle.py file here.
A pdf scientific report will be shared online.
